# Blockchain-Splitwise

In this project we implement a system for users to use a smart contract made by solidity over ethereum to use a debt system in a way that eliminates circular debts.

For example if user A ows user B 100 units of money and user B ows user C 50 units and user C ows user A 20 credits the contract will automatically make it so that user A ows B 80 and B ows C 30 and user C ows nothing to A.

In this project implementing and testing the contract was using Rimix editor and it was connected using javaScript and node.js in file script.js the file for the smart contract is found in BlockchainSplitwise.sol

I will be happy to provide more information on the project and in details upon request

# Blockchain-Splitwise

In this project we implement a system for users to use a smart contract made by solidity over etherium to use a debt system in a way that eliminates circular debts.

For example if user A ows user B 100 units of money and user B ows user C 50 units and user C ows user A 20 credits the contract will automatically make it so that user A ows B 80 and B ows C 30 and user C ows nothing to A.

In this project implementing and testing the contract was using Rimix editor and it was connected using javaScript and node.js in file script.js 

I will be happy to provide more information on the project and in details upon request
